<p>
  Skeletal assumes you are running <a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a>. If
  it is not yet installed on your machine you can get it by running:
</p>

<pre>gem install sass</pre>

<p>
  Once the installation is complete you can grab the source on GitHub and drop
  the <code>skeletal</code>-directory in with your stylesheets.
</p>

<p>
  Add the following line at the top of your Sass-stylesheet to get access to all
  variables and mixins in your own styles:
</p>

<pre>@import 'skeletal/skeletal.scss';</pre>
