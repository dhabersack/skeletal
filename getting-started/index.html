<p>
  Skeletal requires <a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a>, which you can
  install by running:
</p>

<pre>gem install sass</pre>

<p>
  Once the installation is complete you can <a
  href="http://github.com/dhabersack/skeletal">grab the source on GitHub</a> and
  drop the <code>skeletal</code>-directory in with your stylesheets.
</p>

<p>
  Add the following line at the top of your Sass-stylesheet to gain access to
  all variables and mixins in your own styles:
</p>

<pre>@import 'skeletal/skeletal.scss';</pre>

<p>
  No further configuration is required as long as you continue compiling your
  stylesheet with <code>sass watch</code> as usual.
</p>
