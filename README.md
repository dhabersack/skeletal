# Skeletal

Skeletal is a blank slate for website creation. Instead of resetting default browser styling with a reset.css you then have to override, Skeletal comes with sensible defaults in its base.css.


## Note

The stylesheet is currently evolving. CSS rules that do have a shorthand notation are intentionally detailed for development purposes.

A production-ready version will be added once the styles are mature enough.


## Known issues

Skeletal uses HTML5-tags (header, footer, nav, article, section and others) that are not supported by all browsers. Support for those will be added at a later point.


## Problems?

Please open [an issue][issues].
