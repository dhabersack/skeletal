# Skeletal

Skeletal is a blank slate for website creation. Instead of resetting default browser styling with a reset.css you then have to override, Skeletal comes with sensible defaults in its base.css.


## Known issues

Skeletal uses HTML5-tags (header, footer, nav, article, section and others) that are not supported by all browsers. Support for those will be added at a later point.

Currently built on Webkit, support for other browsers not included yet.


## Problems?

Please open [an issue][issues].
