<p>
  Skeletal is a frontend framework that provides a collection of default styles
  and Sass-mixins that help getting up and running on webdesign projects a lot
  quicker than writing everything from scratch does.
</p>

<ol id="characteristics">
  <li>
    <h4>Instant power-up</h4>

    <p>
      You can use Skeletalâ€™s default styles as-is: drop the files in your
      project, add one line to your stylesheet and you are good to go.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Viewer-friendly</h4>

    <p>
      Built-in responsiveness, clean typography and clear organization of
      content make your site simple and user-friendly.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Tried and tested</h4>

    <p>
      Skeletal grew out of real-world projects &mdash; its contents are robust
      and can be used to create a wide range of layouts.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Neatly organized</h4>

    <p>
      Keep your markup clean: all presentational attributes are kept in
      stylesheets for easy maintenance.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Adaptable</h4>

    <p>
      Change the defaults and select which features you want to include to make
      the system meet your requirements.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>More to come</h4>

    <p>
      As it sees more real-world use, new features and refinements will
      constantly be introduced to Skeletal.
